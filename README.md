If you want, I can make a super-short ‚ÄúHR resignation question checklist‚Äù in bullet format, so you can literally have it in front of you and ask everything naturally during a chat or call without missing anything. Do you want me to do that?







I wanted to clarify a few things regarding the resignation process:

1. After submitting my resignation, what is the step-by-step process that usually follows?


2. Regarding company devices (like laptop, access card, etc.), when are these typically expected to be submitted‚Äîimmediately after resignation or only on the last working day?


3. Duri




I wanted to quickly connect with you online before I leave, to thank you for your guidance and support. I‚Äôve learned a lot from your approach and insights, and I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice you could share about my future. Even though my time here was short, I feel I‚Äôve grown and I‚Äôm excited about what I can do next. Looking forward to a brief call with you.
